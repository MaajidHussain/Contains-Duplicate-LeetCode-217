# Contains-Duplicate-LeetCode-217

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Explanation:
The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation:
All elements are distinct.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

Approach:-
I will use a set to track seen elements as I iterate through the list. If any element is found in the set, it indicates a duplicate, and I return True; otherwise, return False after the iteration.
